# Overview:
An overview of earthquake data in relation to tectonic plates location based off longitude and latitude. Calling data from the USGS that provides earthquake data in different formats for constant updates allows our visualization to constantly update as well as display the data. The following visualizations are interactive on the following webpage and will help teams get better acquainted with recent earthquakes and their location based off tectonic plates.

# Summary:
First creating the map using Leaflet to import the earthquake data based on longitude and latitude.

Importing the data to respond the earthquakes to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. As shown, the larger plots and darker the color display the earthquake impact. Also creating a legend for users as seen in the bottom left corner.

The following plot points will also display a pop up that shows magnitude and location.

As we have successfully plotted the points for occurring earthquakes, we have now pulled the second dataset showing the tectonic plates around the earth.

To give the users a friendly map we have included a satellite map that also overlays with the following datasets.
